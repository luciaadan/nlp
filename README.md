### Commands to reproduce main results for Assignment 1
## To run the models first clone the repository to a device using the following command in the terminal
```bash
git clone https://github.com/luciaadan/nlp.git
cd nlp
```

## The project was done in WSL/MacOS and it requires a virtual environment to be run. The necessary files are in the repository but it also needs to be activated on the device so the following command must be executed in the terminal:
```bash
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Since the most important file is a python file, the code can be run in the terminal by the following commands:
```bash
cd notebooks
python3 assignment_1.py
```
